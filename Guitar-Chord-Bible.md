An expansive guitar chord bible/chord-identification and fretboard memorization tool. Maybe also stores your own chord progressions so you can remember them later

Maybe making a full fretboard where you can choose your notes and make tablature.

The more I think about this application, the more excited I get. Just making it could really help me grow as a musician with fretboard fluency, and having my own tab making browser application where I can store all my ideas would be cool too. Also, it could be a useful tool for my band for the purposes of documenting our music.

This is the only idea I have where I think an external API might be used 
-- uberchord api. chord dictionary/library
-- svguitar. chord chart rendering library
