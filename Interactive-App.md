A text based role playing game that stores your characters and save data etc.

This is the idea I've had for this capstone project since the beginning, and the one I tend to lean towards the most. I would love to show my ability to code and manage whole game systems, but for full on video games, making models and textures and animations is just very time consuming. With a browser game with simplified graphics, I could focus on just implementing gameplay systems, and get something closer to working and finished than a full on game. 

This would be helpful for trying to get into game development, but would also just sounds like the most fun and interesting to me.

I'd have to include the ability to save game progress like character stats and progression between gameplay sessions, or npc states like quest progress. The idea would end up being very similar to one of my favorites of all time, Candy Box 1 and 2. These are really silly 'clicker-like' ASCII browser-based role playing games that have some pretty cool gameplay sequences, save games, quests, invemtory and npc states that are all stored.

-- I've been hearing about p5 js, and that might be a great tool to help me draw graphics to the screen and handle event inputs, but I don't know if it actually counts as an API for the sake of this project.
-- otherwise, I'd have to do a lot more research into finding data storing. 

I've been working on a few rpg systems a for a while now, as I've had this idea since the beginning of class, so I feel like I actually have a bit of work already drawn out

The more I think about this, it sounds quite ambitious. I may change this idea to a more simple game. I've been looking into falling sands simulations, and I think that might be a better fit for this project.
I would use the same APIs anyway. It's basically the same idea just a little less ambitious. A little more 'scope' sensitive.
